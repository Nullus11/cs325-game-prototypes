<h2>Dickbutt Defender 2</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    What is original about my game is that it is made mostly from scratch with an idea I had back in highschool during a 24 hour coding session at 1am while chalked up on caffine.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    What is interesting about my game technology is that the enemies are endless and the mouse disappears and is replaced with an image.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    The hardest part of making this game was figuring out how to make endless enemies fall.
    The easiest part of making this game was having the reticle follow the mouse since I used that function in my previous game.
