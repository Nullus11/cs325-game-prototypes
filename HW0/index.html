<h2>Trump Follows</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
What is original about my game is not much since im sure its been done before but i added new mechanics from the base code like having points to gather and having them start from the corners.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
What is interesting about my game technology is that the enemies follow you from wherever you are and when the enemies get to close to one another they spawn new enemeies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
What I learned from this prototype is a lot actually. I learned the === doesnt really work when working with sprite locations and how sprite movement can work.
The easiest part of the prototype was making the points sprite. The hardest part was getting the sprites to respawn when they get too close to one another.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Trump: <a href="https://www.pinclipart.com/picdir/middle/414-4147474_free-donald-trump-icon-donald-trump-head-icon.png">Trump Icon</a></li>
<li>Vote: <a href="https://www.cedarvalleycollege.edu/au/govaffairs/votes/publishingimages/vote-464x464.png">Votes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
The game that most resembles my game to my knowledge would be the Follow Pointer game that I borrowed the code from.
<li>Follow POinter: <a href="http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/physics%5Carcade%5Cmove%20to%20pointer.js"> Follow POinter</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
Collect the votes while dodging the trumps trying to take them.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
The storymatic theme I used is chaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
The input I used was mouse. The randomness I use was the points. The genre I used was arcade. The play style I used was Arcade.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
The game mechanic the prototype was evaluating is following the mouse.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
The experience I want players to have when playing my game is to just have a good time.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The actions that you can do is use the mouse to move around the screen picking up the votes that will give you 10 points each. Your goal is to pick up as many votes as you can. The opposition in my game are the Trumps that follows you around the screen. Their goal is to grab all the votes from you. The way the game ends is when you get hit by a Trump.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Some player strategies I expect that will be effective at playing my game is using the respawn time to grab points and make Trumps respawn to move more freely.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The world my game is set in is the real world during the 2020 election where Trump is running again and trying to steal as many votes as he can. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting is that its all a meme but real at the same time. The backstory of the game is I started with a random follower game and my friend said to change GAME OVER to Thanks Obama. Then a political statement grew from that. Trump trying to steal all the votes from his competitors.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
The demographic I'm trying to reach are the young voters that will understand this is a meme of a game while also realizing the sad truth that this is what he actually does.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
~ 30 seconds a round.
